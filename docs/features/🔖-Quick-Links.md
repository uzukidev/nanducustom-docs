# üîñ Quick Links

You can add and import Quick Links from the settings, and edit them when you right click on them.

An easy way to add a custom icon to your Quick Link is to upload it on somewhere like Imgur, and use that link as an icon. You can also convert your icon to a Data URI (max 8kB).

‚ö†Ô∏è Notice: as a security measure, local paths like `file://`, browser settings links like `about:config` or `chrome://extensions` can't be added. However, `localhost:` links will work just fine.
