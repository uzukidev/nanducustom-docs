# ðŸŒ„ Backgrounds

NanduCustom uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to fetch its backgrounds. We select them manually and store them in four different collections that change according to the time of the day:

- During the day or at night
- 2 hours around sunrise (Noon) and sunset (Evening)

### Custom Unsplash collection

You can make your own collection of images using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). To do so, you'll need to create an Unsplash account and add all your images to a new collection. Once you're pleased with your selection, you need the collection's ID present in its URL. You will spot it easily since it's the string of random letters and numbers. For example, if your collection's URL is `https://unsplash.com/collections/2170139/wolfdogs-of-unsplash`, the ID is `2170139`.

Head back to NanduCustom and paste the ID in the Unsplash collection field. You can add multiple collections by separating them with a comma.

### Local files

Switch your background type from Dynamic to Custom, and you'll be able to drag and drop your own images from your computer to NanduCustom.
