# ⚙️ Settings management

NanduCustom allows you to export all your settings into a file. You can use this feature if you want to save them or share them to someone. You will in turn be able to import said settings into any instance of NanduCustom.

To do so, simply go to the bottom of your settings pannel, then click Export as file in the settings management. Your file will be downloaded. On your other instance of NanduCustom, you can then go to the Import tab of the settings management and drop your file. NanduCustom will reload and all your settings will be applied.

## Browser syncing

NanduCustom is compatible with the automatic syncing features of both Firefox and Chrome. If you log into your Mozilla/Google account on your browser and have syncing enabled in your browser, NanduCustom should get synced to other instances of the same browser on other computers. This is true for all NanduCustom settings as well as Quick Links.
